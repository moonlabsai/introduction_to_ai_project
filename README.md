# Introduction to Your AI and Web Scraping Project

## What's This Project About?

This two-week project will teach you about:

1. Web scraping - collecting information from websites automatically
2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) - using smart computer programs to process information

## Why Are You Doing This?

These skills are important because:

- They help handle large amounts of online information
- Many companies use these techniques for research and analysis
- It's a growing field in technology

## What You'll Learn

During this project, you will:

1. Write code to collect data from websites
2. Clean up the data you collect
3. Use AI tools to analyze and summarize information
4. Build a program that can gather info and write simple reports

## How It Works

- Follow the project plan day by day
- Complete the tasks and check them off as you go
- Ask for help if you get stuck

Remember, even expert coders were beginners once. So don't worry if something seems tricky at first - that's how you learn!

## Ready, Set, Code!

Time to power up your computer and get started. Who knows? By the end of this, you might be teaching the robots a thing or two! ðŸ¤–

Good luck, and have fun with your project!
